I needed a screen video capture program that was free and open source and worked with several different video types. I also wanted the program to record the proper screen colours. So I wrote a small program to do this. It uses mencoder to do the video processing so I will be able to add almost any video format as the output. Current it outputs mpeg/mp3 in an avi container.

It is a 32 bit .NET program. I have tested it on Windows XP, Vista, and 7.

It currently uses a lot of memory, can only record from the primary screen and only does full screen recordings.  It is simple and brute force but it does everything I need.

The source code is release under The Code Project Open License (CPOL) 1.02 (http://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx) because some of the code is from http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/Mp3SoundCapture.aspx.
